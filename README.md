# CGD-Scripts: Public C# Script Library

Welcome! This repository hosts the shared C# scripts for our Unity online multiplayer project. Although the main project is private, these scripts are open for everyone to explore, learn from, and contribute to.

## ü§ù Who We Are
We are a group of media informatics students working together on a networked Unity game. We open-source our scripting layer to share knowledge and invite community contributions.

## üìÇ What‚Äôs Here
All game logic, networking utilities, and helper classes live in this package:
```
Assets/_Scripts/  ‚Üê meant to be used exactly at this path in the main project
```

## üöÄ Installation
1. In your Unity project, add as a submodule under `Assets/_Scripts`:
   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/AroNixBox/CGD-Scripts.git Assets/_Scripts
   git submodule update --init
   ```
2. In existing clones:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
3. Unity will automatically import the scripts on next launch.

## üîß How to Contribute (Code)
